### Question 1

The life in hours of a battery is known to be approximately normally distrubuted with standard deviation σ = 1.25 hours. A random sample of 10 batteries (n=10) has a mean life of x̄ = 40.5 hours. 

**A.** Is there (an) evidence to support the claim that battery life exceeds 40 hours? Use α = 0.05.

**B.** What is the P-value for the test in part A?

**C.** What is the β-error for the text in part B if the true mean life is 42 hours?

**D.** What sample size would be required to ensure that β does not exceed 0310 if the true mean is 44 hours?

**E.** Explain how you could answer the question in part A by calculating an appropriate confidence bound on battery life.
